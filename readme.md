# ðŸ¦¸ Super Basic HTTP API

This is a project with a very simple HTTP API written using ASP.NET Core. Inspired by my work with [Ktor](https://ktor.io), I was curious what kind of minimalism I could achieve when building an HTTP API.

I added some naive form model binding that also supports collections.

## Startup

Endpoints are grouped by `Module` and are a collection of endpoints.

```c#
app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
{
    endpoints.Map<HelloWorldModule>();
});
```

Modules **must be registered** in the services collection, as they are created using the dependency injection of ASP.NET Core. Modules can be registered as **Singleton** or as **Transient**, but it's recommended to register them as **Transient** first.

```c#
public void ConfigureServices(IServiceCollection services)
{
    services.AddSingleton(new Person {Name = "Khalid"});
    services.AddTransient<HelloWorldModule>();
}
```

## Modules

Modules are created using the DI features of ASP.NET Core. That means modules can use constructor dependency injection. In addition to constructor DI, any additional parameters to a method will be resolved from the ServicesCollection.

Endpoints are defined by the presence of an `HttpMethodAttribute`, which comes from ASP.NET MVC. These attributes hold metadata regarding the HTTP methods and the path template.

```c#
public class HelloWorldModule
{
    private readonly Person _person;

    public HelloWorldModule(Person person)
    {
        _person = person;
    }
    
    [HttpGet("/")]
    public async Task Index(HttpContext context, Person person)
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Hello {person.Name}!");
    }

    [HttpGet("/bye")]
    public Task Get(HttpContext context)
    {
        return context.Response.WriteAsync($"Goodbye, {_person.Name}!");
    }

    [HttpGet("/person")]
    public async Task GetPerson(HttpContext context)
    {
        var reader = File.OpenText("./Views/Form.html");
        context.Response.ContentType = "text/html";
        var html = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
        await context.Response.WriteAsync(html);
    }

    [HttpPost("/person")]
    public async Task Post(HttpContext context)
    {
        var person = await context.Request.BindFromFormAsync<PersonRequest>();
        context.Response.ContentType = "text/html";
        await context.Response.WriteAsync($"<h1>&#129321; Happy Birthday, {person.Name} ({person.Birthday:d})!</h1>");
        await context.Response.WriteAsync($"<h2>Counting {string.Join(",",person.Count)}...</h2>");
    }
    
}
```
